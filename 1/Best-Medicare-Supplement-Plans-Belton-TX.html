<p>Medicare Part B covers your outpatient medical companies, like your annual wellness exam.

Some recipients will not pay the total $a hundred and forty four.60 standard premium due to a "hold harmless" provision that forestalls their Part B premiums from rising more than their Social Security cost-of-residing adjustment, or COLA. The commonplace month-to-month premium for Medicare Part B might be $144.60 for 2020, up $9.10 from $a hundred thirty five.50 in 2019, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced Friday.<p>
