If you're required to pay a premium for Part A as a retiree, you are not required to enroll in Medicare Parts A and B. However, UC does require that you simply ship in a denial letter from Social Security to maintain your present coverage. Some of UC’s retiree medical plans have Medicare versions and a few have a corresponding companion plan (UC Care, CORE, UC Blue & Gold).
