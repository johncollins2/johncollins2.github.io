<p>Generally you possibly can enroll in Medicare solely in the course of the Medicare basic enrollment interval . Generally, if an individual continues to be working and has employer-sponsored Group Health Plan coverage based mostly on that employment, they can delay enrollment in Part B and can enroll later during a SEP.
