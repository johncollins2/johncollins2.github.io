<p>As a basic rule, people who plan to proceed to work (and have employer-sponsored health coverage) past age 65 need to check with the employer-sponsored health plan to see whether they should enroll in Part B or not. This comes with an employer request for info form generally known as L564. Your employer can fill in that you simply’ve had coverage through them for the reason that month you turned 65, thus qualifying you for particular enrollment into Medicare Part B. Unfortunately I’m not acquainted with union laws mandating that you sign up for Medicare at a given time.<p>
