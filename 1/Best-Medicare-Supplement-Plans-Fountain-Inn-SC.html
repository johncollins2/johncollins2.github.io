During the pandemic, the Social Security Administration, which handles Medicare enrollment, has temporarily closed its native offices.<p>
<p>People with ESRD have the option to enroll in Medicare Advantage for 2021, and CMS expects greater than forty,000 to do so. This might be notably advantageous for beneficiaries with ESRD who're beneath age sixty five and dwelling in states that don’t guarantee access to Medigap plans for people beneath the age of 65.<p>
