You cannot have a Medicare Supplement plan and a Medicare Advantage plan at the same time. If you don't make any changes throughout AEP, your current plan will mechanically renew the following 12 months. The Special Enrollment Period lets you enroll in Original Medicare outside of your IEP as a result of certain life changes. For instance, you would possibly wait to enroll if you're still working.<p>
<p>The size of Medicare Advantage provider networks for physicians and hospitals vary tremendously each throughout counties and across plans in the identical county. NoteEach yr, plans set the amounts they cost for premiums, deductibles, and companies. The plan decides how much you pay for the lined companies you get.<p>

<p>Remember that if you do not enroll in Medicare Part B during your Special Enrollment Period, you’ll have to attend till the following General Enrollment Period, which happens from January 1 to March 31 annually. You could then have to pay a late-enrollment penalty for Medicare Part B since you may have had Part B and didn't enroll. If you owe a late-enrollment penalty, you’ll pay a 10% greater premium for each 12-month period that you simply have been eligible for Medicare Part B but didn’t join it. You might need to pay this larger premium for so long as you’re enrolled in Medicare.<p>
<p>The basic enrollment period for Original Medicare is from January 1 through March 31 of each year. Keep in thoughts that you could have to pay a late enrollment penalty for Medicare Part A and/or Part B should you didn't join when you were first eligible. If you have health coverage by way of present employment (either via your work or your spouse’s employer), you could decide to delay Medicare Part B enrollment. You should speak along with your employer’s health benefits administrator so that you just perceive how your present coverage works with Medicare and what the implications could be should you drop Medicare Part B.<p>
<p>If you qualify, you can return to Original Medicare or join, change or drop a Medicare Advantage or Medicare prescription drug plan. If you select to return to Original Medicare in this qualifying event, you may also apply for a Medicare Supplement plan. There are many types of qualifying events, including shifting into or out of a care facility, or shifting out of your current plan’s service space. Some states may have further open enrollment durations, and there may be other situations in which your acceptance could also be assured.<p>
