Medicare Advantage plans would possibly save you money, but be sure to check whether prescription drug benefits are included. If not, you’ll want to buy a separate Part D plan if you'd like that coverage. Also check the price of any premiums, co-pays, and other out-of-pocket expenses, and whether or not there are any limits of their coverage.
