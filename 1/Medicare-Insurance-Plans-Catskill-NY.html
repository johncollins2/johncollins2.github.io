<p>Generally you can enroll in Medicare only through the Medicare general enrollment interval . Generally, if an individual continues to be working and has employer-sponsored Group Health Plan coverage primarily based on that employment, they will delay enrollment in Part B and can enroll later throughout a SEP. For instance, employer coverage for retirees or by way of COBRA doesn’t rely as current employment, so these people don’t qualify for a SEP to enroll in Medicare later.<p>
