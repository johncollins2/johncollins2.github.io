<p>Third, individuals who reside in two different geographical areas of the nation at completely different times of the 12 months (mostly so-referred to as snowbirds) find it troublesome to stay with the geographic restrictions of most public Part C plans. The Part C risk adjusted funds to Medicare Advantage plans are designed to limit this churn between forms of Medicare (managed vs. FFS), but it's unclear how efficient that equalization program is.
