<p>Recently, I began a part-time job and noticed that the corporate in withdrawal money for Medicare. When very small employers join together with different employers in conditions like this, the plan will provide major coverage as long as no less than one of the employers has 20+ staff. But employers can even ask for exceptions to the primary/secondary rule in that circumstance, so he’ll need to check along with his group plan to see what their specific rules are.
