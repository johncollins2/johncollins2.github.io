<p>Please note that you simply can not have each a stand-alone Medicare prescription drug plan and a Medicare Advantage plan that includes drug coverage.

<h3>Keys to Choose the Best Medical Insurance in Springfield</h3>

<p>And Medicare will certainly not require you to maintain it once you enroll. Once your group health coverage ends, you get a special enrollment interval that lasts eight months. Though you don’t must enroll in Medicare at age 65 when you have coverage via a certified group health plan, doing so may make sense if that plan isn’t closely sponsored by your employer.<p>
