You don’t have to join Medicare this yr when you don’t need to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare nicely after 65, you need to half HSA contributions six months before you sign up to avoid tax penalties as a result of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare.
