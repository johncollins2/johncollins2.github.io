<p>In common, you may need to pay this penalty for so long as you have a Medicare drug plan. The cost of the late enrollment penalty is determined by how lengthy you went without Part D or creditable prescription drug coverage.<p>

When very small employers be a part of along with different employers in conditions like this, the plan will provide primary coverage so long as a minimum of one of the employers has 20+ staff. But employers also can ask for exceptions to the primary/secondary rule in that circumstance, so he’ll need to check together with his group plan to see what their particular rules are.
