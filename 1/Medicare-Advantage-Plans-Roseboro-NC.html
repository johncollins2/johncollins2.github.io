The Medicare model of your current plan may have totally different benefits, medical doctors, service areas and behavioral health providers than the non-Medicare version.<p>
<p>But these averages masks wide regional and beneficial differences. Just as crucial advantage of Part C plans is the annual out of pocket spend safety, the most important determinant of month-to-month premium differences is the scale of that protection. By law, a Part C beneficiary can't spend more than $6700 out of pocket annually on medical providers; it's plans with this limit that have the lowest premiums. Conversely, some Part C plans have OOP limits as little as $1500 annually but in fact -- for these plans -- the premium is greater.

Medicare is our nation's medical insurance program for individuals age sixty five or older.<p>
