And, should you're over the age of 65 you will need to finish a piece test requirement before going back to work part-time or full-time.<p>
<p>Remember, if you don’t join Medicare when you’re first eligible and don’t have other coverage primarily based on current employment, you would need to pay a late-enrollment penalty later if you do enroll.

<p>You can enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan whenever you’re first eligible for Medicare, or during the annual Medicare open enrollment period in the fall . If you’re enrolled in both Medicare Part A and Part B , you’re eligible to enroll in a Medigap plan to supplement your Medicare coverage. You’ll have a six-month assured-concern window throughout which you'll sign up for any Medigap plan out there in your space.
