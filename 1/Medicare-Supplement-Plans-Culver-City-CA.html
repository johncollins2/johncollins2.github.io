<p>If you’re drawing Social Security, you’ll be mechanically enrolled. You can join or postpone your Part B by contacting the Social Security Administration directly.<p>
<p>Private Fee-For-Service plans PFFS plans might or could not have a provider network, but cover any provider who accepts Medicare.

Territories who are already amassing Social Security—either disability or retirement—are mechanically enrolled into Part A and Part B once they’re first eligible.<p>
<p>And Medicare will definitely not require you to keep it when you enroll. Once your group health coverage ends, you get a special enrollment interval that lasts eight months. Though you don’t need to enroll in Medicare at age 65 in case you have coverage through a certified group health plan, doing so may make sense if that plan isn’t heavily subsidized by your employer.<p>

<p>But it looks such as you’ll be enrolling at Medicare at sixty five, in which case you don’t get retro benefits because you weren’t entitled to them previous to sixty five. Hi Karen, whenever you enroll in Medicare Part A, you may be penalized for continuing to contribute to an HSA. Your Part A will take effect back to the date you qualified for Medicare .<p>
