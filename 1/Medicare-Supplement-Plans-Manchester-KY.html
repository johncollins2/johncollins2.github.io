<p>I am now ready to see what, if any of the outstanding bills, might be coated by Medicare Part A. Thank you in your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to sign up for Medicare this yr if you don’t need to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare nicely after 65, you need to half HSA contributions six months before you sign up to keep away from tax penalties due to Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can proceed contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare because should you enroll well after age 65 (which it sounds like you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
<p>If you do not have Medicare otherwise you need to sign up for Part A , contactSocial Security. Your plan leaves the Medicare program in the course of the yr. There are deadlines for enrolling in different components of Medicare. We clarify these deadlines and the penalties you could accrue should you miss them.<p>
