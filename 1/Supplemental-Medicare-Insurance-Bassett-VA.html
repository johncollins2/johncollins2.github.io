<p>I am now ready to see what, if any of the excellent bills, shall be covered by Medicare Part A. Thank you for your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to enroll in Medicare this year when you don’t wish to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare properly after 65, you must half HSA contributions six months before you signal up to avoid tax penalties due to Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can proceed contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare because should you enroll nicely after age 65 (which it sounds such as you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
<p>If you do not have Medicare or you want to enroll in Part A , contactSocial Security. Your plan leaves the Medicare program in the middle of the yr.
