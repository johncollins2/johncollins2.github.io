<p>I am now ready to see what, if any of the outstanding bills, will be coated by Medicare Part A. Thank you for your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to sign up for Medicare this yr should you don’t wish to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare nicely after sixty five, you should half HSA contributions six months earlier than you sign up to avoid tax penalties because of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of when you enroll properly after age 65 (which it sounds like you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
