<p>If you aren't signing up for Medicare at 65 and currently have company offered group coverage, are you required to verify this with Medicare? What I am trying to clarify is what precisely do you have to do to keep away from these penalties for not signing up you check with. How do they confirm whether you have or didn’t have a gaggle health plan?<p>
<p>Call or go to the web site of your State Health Insurance Assistance Program . Your local SHIP might help you understand your Medicare coverage options and navigate any changes.

If you have not but tapped Social Security, the burden is on you to sign up. In that case, you get a seven-month enrollment interval that begins three months earlier than your birthday month and ends three months after that.<p>
<p>The eight-month interval begins after the month your employment or employer coverage ends, whichever comes first. You can enroll in Original Medicare beginning three months before you flip 65, until you qualify earlier.<p>
