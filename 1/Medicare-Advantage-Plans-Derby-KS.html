Once the OOP maximum is reached for a person beneath a Part C health plan, the plan pays one hundred% of medical services for the rest of the calendar 12 months. That protection has no lifetime maximum, another drawback with Medicare Part A which has a lifetime restrict on inpatient hospitalization coverage. But the Part C OOP limit does not apply to a Part C plan's Part-D-like self-administered drug coverage .<p>
