<p>Generally you possibly can enroll in Medicare solely in the course of the Medicare common enrollment interval . Generally, if a person is still working and has employer-sponsored Group Health Plan coverage primarily based on that employment, they'll delay enrollment in Part B and might enroll later during a SEP.
