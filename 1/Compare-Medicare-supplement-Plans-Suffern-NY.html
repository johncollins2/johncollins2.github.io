<h3>Overusing Your Health Insurance in Suffern</h3>
<p>Remember that if you don't enroll in Medicare Part B during your Special Enrollment Period, you’ll have to wait till the next General Enrollment Period, which occurs from January 1 to March 31 each year. You could then need to pay a late-enrollment penalty for Medicare Part B since you might have had Part B and didn't enroll. If you owe a late-enrollment penalty, you’ll pay a ten% greater premium for every 12-month period that you had been eligible for Medicare Part B however didn’t sign up for it. You might should pay this greater premium for so long as you’re enrolled in Medicare.<p>
<p>The general enrollment interval for Original Medicare is from January 1 by way of March 31 of every yr. Keep in mind that you could have to pay a late enrollment penalty for Medicare Part A and/or Part B if you didn't sign up if you were first eligible. If you have health coverage through current employment (either by way of your work or your partner’s employer), you could decide to delay Medicare Part B enrollment.

<p>Yes, these may be complex calculations, however an insurance dealer may help by doing the mathematics for you and making cost-saving recommendations. Medigap policies are private plans, available from insurance companies or via brokers, however not onmedicare.gov.<p>
<p>And Medicare will certainly not require you to keep it when you enroll. Once your group health coverage ends, you get a special enrollment interval that lasts eight months. Though you don’t have to enroll in Medicare at age 65 when you have coverage via a professional group health plan, doing so would possibly make sense if that plan isn’t closely backed by your employer.<p>
