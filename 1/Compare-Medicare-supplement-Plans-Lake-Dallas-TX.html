<p>When you enroll with a Medicare Advantage Plan, you pay 2 premiums each month — a premium for your Advantage coverage and a separate premium for Medicare Part B coverage. These plans often also have larger deductibles, so you need to carefully compare these plans with your income earlier than making a decision. Instead of merely responding to a gross sales pitch from an insurance agent or to an ad, check all of the Medicare options in your space. Compare plans using the Medicare Options Compare device at Medicare.gov/mppf, looking at each premiums and total estimated prices for folks like your self. For example, your Medicare Advantage plan might have a $15 copay when you see the physician.<p>

Also check the cost of any premiums, co-pays, and different out-of-pocket expenses, and whether there are any limits in their coverage. If extra benefits are included, such as help with hearing aids and dental bills, remember to learn the way much of these bills will truly be coated.<p>
<p>The Medicare Rights Center was not able to confirm that all ministries work this way, however it might be clever for you to think about that your ministry has such a requirement. Your evaluate ought to embody whether there's coverage for prescription drugs. These are not coated by Parts A or B, but usually require a Part D drug plan from a private insurer.
