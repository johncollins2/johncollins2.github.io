<p>I am now ready to see what, if any of the outstanding payments, will be covered by Medicare Part A. Thank you for your assist Mr. Backman. You don’t have to sign up for Medicare this yr when you don’t need to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare well after 65, you need to half HSA contributions six months before you signal as much as keep away from tax penalties because of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can proceed contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of should you enroll properly after age sixty five (which it sounds such as you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
