<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the outstanding bills, will be covered by Medicare Part A. Thank you in your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to join Medicare this year when you don’t need to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare properly after 65, you should half HSA contributions six months before you sign up to keep away from tax penalties as a result of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of when you enroll nicely after age 65 (which it sounds such as you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
