It is important to remember that if you're happy with your Medicare benefits, whether you're in traditional Medicare or an MA plan, you don't HAVE to alter when the opportunity arises. In addition, those with coverage via their current or former employer ought to check to see how any changes may have an effect on such coverage.<p>
<p>But as of Jan. 2, 2020, the two plans that cover deductibles—plans C and F—cannot be bought to new Medigap beneficiaries. En español <p>
