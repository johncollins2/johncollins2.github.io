You’re eligible to enroll in Medicare Part D as long as you've either Medicare Part A or Part B.<p>
<p>You and your spouse pay separate premiums for Medicare benefits underneath Medicare Part B, and Medicare Part D when you sign up for it.

Some recipients will not pay the complete $a hundred and forty four.60 commonplace premium due to a "hold innocent" provision that forestalls their Part B premiums from rising more than their Social Security cost-of-dwelling adjustment, or COLA.
