<p>Coverage from an employer through the SHOP Marketplace is handled the same as coverage from any job-based mostly health plan. If you’re getting health coverage from an employer through the SHOP Marketplace primarily based in your or your partner’s current job, Medicare Secondary Payer guidelines apply.

<p>As a common rule, people who plan to continue to work (and have employer-sponsored health coverage) past age 65 must discuss with the employer-sponsored health plan to see whether or not they need to enroll in Part B or not. This comes with an employer request for info form known as L564. Your employer can fill in that you’ve had coverage via them because the month you turned 65, thus qualifying you for particular enrollment into Medicare Part B. Unfortunately I’m not conversant in union legal guidelines mandating that you join Medicare at a given time.<p>
<p>Remember, should you don’t sign up for Medicare when you’re first eligible and don’t produce other coverage based mostly on present employment, you can have to pay a late-enrollment penalty later whenever you do enroll. "We advise individuals even if they don't take medication right now, no less than join the most affordable drug plan simply so you do not face a penalty," Roberts stated.<p>
