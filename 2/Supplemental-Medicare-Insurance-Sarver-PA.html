Prior authorization is most frequently required for comparatively costly providers, similar to inpatient hospital stays, expert nursing facility stays, and Part B medication, however occasionally required for preventive providers. Beginning in 2019, Medicare Advantage plans can even require enrollees to use “step remedy” for Part B medicine, that means that they are required to try some specific medicine earlier than they obtain approval to try other medication. In distinction to Medicare Advantage plans, conventional Medicare does not typically require prior authorization for providers, and doesn't require step remedy for Part B medication.<p>
