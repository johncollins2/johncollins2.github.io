<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the excellent bills, might be covered by Medicare Part A. Thank you in your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to sign up for Medicare this yr when you don’t need to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare well after 65, you should half HSA contributions six months earlier than you sign up to avoid tax penalties due to Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can proceed contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of when you enroll nicely after age sixty five (which it sounds such as you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
