When very small employers join along with different employers in conditions like this, the plan will provide major coverage as long as at least one of the employers has 20+ employees. But employers also can ask for exceptions to the primary/secondary rule in that circumstance, so he’ll have to check along with his group plan to see what their particular rules are.
