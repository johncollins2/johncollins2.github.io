<p>But these averages masks extensive regional and beneficial differences. Just as the most important benefit of Part C plans is the annual out of pocket spend protection, the major determinant of month-to-month premium differences is the scale of that safety. By law, a Part C beneficiary can't spend more than $6700 out of pocket yearly on medical providers; it is plans with this limit which have the bottom premiums. Conversely, some Part C plans have OOP limits as little as $1500 annually but after all -- for these plans -- the premium is larger. Note that an OOP limit is not a deductible as is commonly reported.<p>
