<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the excellent payments, shall be covered by Medicare Part A. Thank you in your assist Mr. Backman. You don’t have to sign up for Medicare this 12 months when you don’t need to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare properly after sixty five, you need to half HSA contributions six months earlier than you sign up to avoid tax penalties due to Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of should you enroll properly after age 65 (which it sounds like you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
