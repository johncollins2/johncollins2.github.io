If you resolve to delay your Social Security retirement benefits or Railroad Retirement Benefits beyond age 65, there's an option to enroll in simply Medicare and apply for retirement benefits at a later time.<p>
<p>You and your partner pay separate premiums for Medicare benefits under Medicare Part B, and Medicare Part D when you sign up for it. If one or both of you select to enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan, you will proceed to pay individually the Medicare Part B premium and presumably a separate plan premium.

<p>You may have to pay the next premium for late enrollment in Part A and/or a higher premium for late enrollment in Part B.

<p>Instead, you’ll obtain a bill for Medicare Part B for as long as you aren’t yet amassing Social Security. If you enroll in Medicare Part A, you’ll should cease contributing to your HSA.<p>
<p>By contrast, most Medicare Advantage plans negotiate payment rates and form networks with healthcare suppliers, just like how purely private medical health insurance plans function.

<p>Consider plan prices, plan medical doctors, convenience, your way of life and travel plans, your health, and any extra benefits in making your Medicare coverage choices. Prioritize plan suppliers that provide low premiums and out-of-pocket maximums. Have a special condition that requires extra customized providers? Work together with your major care provider and your loved ones to decide on a plan you could afford and that has the coverages you’ll use the most. Advantage plans limit what you'll be able to pay out-of-pocket for coverage.<p>
