You don’t have to enroll in Medicare this yr should you don’t need to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare well after sixty five, you need to half HSA contributions six months before you sign up to avoid tax penalties as a result of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of if you enroll well after age sixty five (which it sounds such as you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
<p>Generally you can enroll in Medicare only through the Medicare common enrollment interval .
