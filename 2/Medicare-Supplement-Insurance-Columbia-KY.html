Medicare MSA Plans mix a excessive deductible Medicare Advantage Plan and a trust or custodial savings account (as outlined and/or accredited by the IRS).<p>
<p>Many Advantage plans also embrace additional benefits, like vision and dental protections or Medicare prescription drug coverage (generally known as “Medicare Part D”). You might hear your medical service provider refer to Medicare Advantage plans as a Part C plan.
