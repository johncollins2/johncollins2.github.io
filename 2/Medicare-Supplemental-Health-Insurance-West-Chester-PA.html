<p>When you enroll with a Medicare Advantage Plan, you pay 2 premiums every month — a premium on your Advantage coverage and a separate premium for Medicare Part B coverage. These plans usually even have greater deductibles, so you should rigorously compare these plans with your income earlier than making a decision. Instead of merely responding to a sales pitch from an insurance agent or to an ad, check all the Medicare options in your area. Compare plans utilizing the Medicare Options Compare tool at Medicare.gov/mppf, looking at each premiums and complete estimated prices for individuals like yourself.

You can't, however, pair a Medigap coverage with an Advantage Plan.<p>
