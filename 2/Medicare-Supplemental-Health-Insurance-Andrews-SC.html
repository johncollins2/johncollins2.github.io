<p>But you’ll still need to pay the government a premium for Part B, in addition to the premium you pay for Medicare Advantage (which may be $0, relying on the plan). Any time through the 12 months, a person enrolled in Original Medicare can apply for a different Medigap plan.

This data may help you resolve if it is time to change plans.<p>
<p>Remember, should you don’t join Medicare whenever you’re first eligible and don’t produce other coverage primarily based on current employment, you can need to pay a late-enrollment penalty later if you do enroll.
