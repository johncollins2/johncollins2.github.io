<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the excellent bills, shall be covered by Medicare Part A. Thank you for your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to enroll in Medicare this 12 months if you don’t wish to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare properly after sixty five, you must half HSA contributions six months before you signal as much as keep away from tax penalties due to Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule.
