<p>As a common rule, people who plan to proceed to work (and have employer-sponsored health coverage) past age 65 must check with the employer-sponsored health plan to see whether or not they need to enroll in Part B or not. This comes with an employer request for information form known as L564. Your employer can fill in that you simply’ve had coverage by way of them because the month you turned 65, thus qualifying you for special enrollment into Medicare Part B. Unfortunately I’m not familiar with union legal guidelines mandating that you simply join Medicare at a given time.<p>
