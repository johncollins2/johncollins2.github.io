So when you have a preferred care provider that’s outside of your Advantage plan’s network, you might must pay extra for care.<p>
<p>As a common rule, people who plan to proceed to work (and have employer-sponsored health coverage) past age 65 have to confer with the employer-sponsored health plan to see whether they should enroll in Part B or not.
