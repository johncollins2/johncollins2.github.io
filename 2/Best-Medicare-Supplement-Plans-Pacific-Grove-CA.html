<p>Yes, these can be complex calculations, however an insurance broker might help by doing the math for you and making cost-saving recommendations. Medigap policies are private plans, available from insurance companies or by way of brokers, but not onmedicare.gov.<p>
<p>But these averages masks broad regional and helpful variations.
