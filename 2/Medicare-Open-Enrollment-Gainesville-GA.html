These individuals are advised to contact Social Security three months before turning age sixty five to inquire about Part B enrollment options and whether or not late enrollment penalties apply if enrollment is deferred.

<p>Enrollment in I-SNPs has been increasing, but is still less than a hundred,000 beneficiaries. For many years, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has posted high quality rankings of Medicare Advantage plans to supply beneficiaries with additional information about plans offered of their space. Prior authorization is most often required for relatively costly services, similar to inpatient hospital stays, skilled nursing facility stays, and Part B drugs, but infrequently required for preventive providers. Beginning in 2019, Medicare Advantage plans can even require enrollees to use “step therapy” for Part B medication, which means that they're required to try some specific drugs before they obtain approval to try other medication. In distinction to Medicare Advantage plans, traditional Medicare does not usually require prior authorization for providers, and does not require step therapy for Part B drugs.<p>

About 7% of beneficiaries can pay extra from earnings-related adjustment amounts.<p>
