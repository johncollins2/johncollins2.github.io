Administration at to enroll in Medicare or to ask questions about whether you are eligible.<p>
<p>You and your partner pay separate premiums for Medicare benefits underneath Medicare Part B, and Medicare Part D should you sign up for it. If one or each of you select to enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan, you'll continue to pay individually the Medicare Part B premium and presumably a separate plan premium. For example, you may determine to stay with Original Medicare, and join a stand-alone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan.<p>
