Switch from Original Medicare to Medicare Advantage (so long as you’re enrolled in each Medicare Part A and Part B, and you reside in the Medicare Advantage plan’s service space).<p>
<p>After you enroll in Original Medicare, you can even apply for a plan with additional coverage via private insurance corporations like UnitedHealthcare.
