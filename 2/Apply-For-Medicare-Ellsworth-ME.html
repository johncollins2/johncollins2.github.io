An individual could also be eligible for premium free Part A in the event that they or their spouse paid Medicare taxes whereas working.<p>
<p>And though your enrollment window is seven months long, you should enroll during the three months prior to your birthday month so as to have coverage that takes impact the first of the month that you just flip 65.

If you enroll during the common enrollment interval, your coverage will begin July 1 of that yr. You might must pay a late enrollment penalty if you didn’t sign up for Medicare when you were first eligible.<p>
