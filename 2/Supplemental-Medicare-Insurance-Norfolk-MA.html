<p>I am now ready to see what, if any of the outstanding bills, might be covered by Medicare Part A. Thank you in your assist Mr. Backman. You don’t have to join Medicare this yr if you don’t wish to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare well after 65, you must half HSA contributions six months earlier than you sign as much as keep away from tax penalties as a result of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule.
