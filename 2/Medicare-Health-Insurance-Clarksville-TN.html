<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the excellent bills, might be lined by Medicare Part A. Thank you in your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to join Medicare this 12 months if you don’t want to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare well after sixty five, you must half HSA contributions six months earlier than you signal up to avoid tax penalties due to Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can proceed contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare.
