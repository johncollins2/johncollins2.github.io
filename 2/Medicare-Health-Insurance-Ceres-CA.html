<p> Turning 65 is the trigger level for the overwhelming majority of Americans to enroll in Medicare. Since the Social Security Administration handles enrollments, you'll usually join at the Social Security office nearest you or on-line at SSA.gov. Failing to enroll in Medicare on time might cost you, so pay attention to the various enrollment options outlined under to keep from getting hit with a penalty for lacking the sign-up window.<p>
