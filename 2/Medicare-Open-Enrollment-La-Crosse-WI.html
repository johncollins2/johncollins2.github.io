<p>If you're turning 65 and have employer-based coverage via your personal job, you can delay signing up. Is the insurance by way of your work, or do you buy it separately/individually?

<p>Just remember that if you select to attend to enroll in Part B, you’ll be charged a late enrollment penalty, and Part B coverage will cost you more. You have to have both Part A and Part B to enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan or a Medicare Supplement plan. You do not have to enroll in Part B instantly, since you'll be charged a premium.

Some of those "qualifying occasions" might embrace retiring and now not having coverage from an employer or moving out of your current plan’s service space.<p>
