The plans also provide extra benefits which are well-liked with the aged, including health club memberships and eyeglasses and sometimes are cheaper than standard Medicare. Once the OOP maximum is reached for a person underneath a Part C health plan, the plan pays 100% of medical services for the rest of the calendar 12 months. That safety has no lifetime maximum, another problem with Medicare Part A which has a lifetime limit on inpatient hospitalization coverage. But the Part C OOP restrict does not apply to a Part C plan's Part-D-like self-administered drug coverage .<p>
