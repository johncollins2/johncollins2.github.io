As a result of these decisions, you may have variations in your Medicare benefits. There are four “parts” to the Medicare insurance program, each providing a sure set of Medicare benefits.<p>
<p> The Medicare Advantage program offers people an alternate method of receiving their Medicare benefits. The program consists of many alternative health plans which are regulated by Medicare however run by private insurance companies.
