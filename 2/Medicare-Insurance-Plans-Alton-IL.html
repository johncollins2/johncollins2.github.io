<p>Enrollment in I-SNPs has been rising, but remains to be lower than 100,000 beneficiaries. For a few years, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has posted quality rankings of Medicare Advantage plans to provide beneficiaries with extra details about plans offered of their space. Prior authorization is most frequently required for relatively costly providers, corresponding to inpatient hospital stays, expert nursing facility stays, and Part B medication, however infrequently required for preventive services. Beginning in 2019, Medicare Advantage plans can also require enrollees to use “step remedy” for Part B drugs, meaning that they're required to try some particular drugs before they receive approval to attempt other medicine. In contrast to Medicare Advantage plans, traditional Medicare doesn't generally require prior authorization for services, and does not require step remedy for Part B medicine.<p>
