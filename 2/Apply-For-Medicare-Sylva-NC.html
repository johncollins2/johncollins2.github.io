Just as the most important advantage of Part C plans is the annual out of pocket spend protection, the main determinant of month-to-month premium differences is the size of that protection. By regulation, a Part C beneficiary cannot spend greater than $6700 out of pocket annually on medical providers; it's plans with this restrict which have the bottom premiums.
