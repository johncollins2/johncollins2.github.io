<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the outstanding payments, will be lined by Medicare Part A. Thank you for your assist Mr. Backman. You don’t have to sign up for Medicare this yr if you don’t wish to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare nicely after sixty five, you need to half HSA contributions six months before you signal as much as avoid tax penalties due to Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare.
