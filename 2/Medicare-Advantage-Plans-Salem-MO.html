That said, it typically pays to enroll in Medicare Part A on time even when you have health coverage already. It gained’t cost you something, and this fashion, Medicare can serve as your secondary insurance and probably pick up the tab for anything your major insurance doesn’t cover. If you do not sign up for Part B when you're first eligible, you could have to pay a late enrollment penalty.<p>
<p>You can apply for a Medicare Supplement insurance plan any time during the 12 months. The Special Enrollment Period allows you to change or add Medicare Advantage or Medicare prescription drug coverage outside of AEP as a result of certain qualifying events.

<p>These programs are also designed to fill in gaps that Medicare doesn't cover.

If you lost your job and signed up for COBRA to extend your employer's health coverage, this does not shield you in opposition to late penalties for not signing up for Medicare. During the pandemic, the Social Security Administration, which handles Medicare enrollment, has briefly closed its native places of work.<p>
<p>You can delay your Part B effective date as much as three months when you enroll whilst you still have employer-sponsored coverage or inside one month after that coverage ends.

<p>Be certain to be conscious that when he does take Social Security, he shall be enrolled in Part A, effective six months retroactively.

<p>These revenue limits apply in 2020, and are indexed for inflation. There is no longer a donut gap in terms of the maximum amount that enrollees can be charged when they fill prescriptions.
