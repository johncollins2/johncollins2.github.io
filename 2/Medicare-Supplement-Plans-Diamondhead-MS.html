<p>A rebate can't contribute to "profit" ("profit" is in quotes as a result of most Medicare Advantage and other Part C health plans are sponsored by non-revenue organizations, primarily built-in health delivery systems). In 2017, the common out-of-pocket limit for MA-PD enrollees is $5,219, about the identical as in 2016 ($5,223) and up from $four,313 in 2011 .
