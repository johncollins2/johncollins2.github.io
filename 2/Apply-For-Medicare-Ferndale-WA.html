You can continue contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare because should you enroll well after age 65 (which it sounds like you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
