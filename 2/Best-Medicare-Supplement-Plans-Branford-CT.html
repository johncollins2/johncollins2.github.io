Just as the most important advantage of Part C plans is the annual out of pocket spend safety, the major determinant of monthly premium variations is the size of that protection. By law, a Part C beneficiary can't spend more than $6700 out of pocket yearly on medical providers; it's plans with this limit which have the bottom premiums. Conversely, some Part C plans have OOP limits as low as $1500 yearly but in fact -- for these plans -- the premium is higher. Note that an OOP limit just isn't a deductible as is usually reported.<p>
