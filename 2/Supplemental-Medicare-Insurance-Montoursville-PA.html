Your employer can fill in that you just’ve had coverage through them for the reason that month you turned 65, thus qualifying you for special enrollment into Medicare Part B. Unfortunately I’m not acquainted with union legal guidelines mandating that you join Medicare at a given time.<p>
<p>When you file on your personal retirement benefit, you will obtain a further payment roughly equal to the amount by which your retirement benefit exceeds your spousal benefit.
