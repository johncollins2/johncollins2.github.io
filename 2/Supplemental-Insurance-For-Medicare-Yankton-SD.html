<p>As a basic rule, individuals who plan to continue to work (and have employer-sponsored health coverage) previous age 65 must check with the employer-sponsored health plan to see whether they need to enroll in Part B or not. This comes with an employer request for data form often known as L564. Your employer can fill in that you’ve had coverage via them for the reason that month you turned sixty five, thus qualifying you for particular enrollment into Medicare Part B.
