<p>Be positive to be aware that when he does take Social Security, he will be enrolled in Part A, effective six months retroactively. Having Part A will disqualify any HSA contributions he makes for that portion of the 12 months, which may result in penalties.

<p>Most Americans start accumulating social security as quickly as they'll. And while that is fantastic when you don’t have a alternative, if you can, holding off for a few years will allow you an even bigger payout later.
