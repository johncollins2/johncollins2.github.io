<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the excellent bills, shall be lined by Medicare Part A. Thank you on your assist Mr. Backman. You don’t have to join Medicare this yr if you don’t need to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare well after 65, you should half HSA contributions six months earlier than you sign as much as avoid tax penalties as a result of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can proceed contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare because should you enroll properly after age sixty five (which it sounds like you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
<p>Is the 6 month retroactive interval for medicare from the day medicare coverage starts or the day you apply for medicare coverage. Do I even have to cease HSA contributions on April 1 or May 1 (6 months back from date coverage starts.<p>

Compare these costs to those of purchasing Medigap and stand-alone Medicare Part D prescription drug insurance policies.

<p>You can call Social Security or go to your native Social Security workplace when you have extra questions.
